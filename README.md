# what is this?
### this is some personal files for my own houses, and some useful (maybe) tools that any house can use

## why is this?
### idk

## what is "useful"
### AntiBot.htsl utilizes playTime.htsl to check if someone is sus and likely a bot. if their 2 strikes are passed, they get instantly tp'd to a place where you'll hopefully put an action pad to kick them (or just ban them)

### PlayerIDs.htsl is my go on player ids. not much to say

### playTime.htsl is my 1h 30m attempt of making playtime. while it's very bad, it still works.

### CookieEvent is a custom cookie item and a script to detect if someone gives a cookie (which breaks every week lmao)

### MasterTools is not finished but designed to allow anyone with the perms to push actions onto players without any action pad/button, the item is not required.
